%% This file defines the target address parameters.
%% The data is inserted into the snmpTargetAddrTable defined
%% in SNMP-TARGET-MIB, and in the snmpTargetAddrExtTable defined
%% in SNMP-COMMUNITY-MIB.
%% Each row is a 10 or 11-tuple (Domain is optional):
%% {Name, 
%%  Domain, Ip, Port, 
%%  Timeout, RetryCount, TagList, ParamsName, EngineId,
%%  TMask, MaxMessageSize}.
%% The value of Domain decide the format of the Ip and TMask values. 
%% If not present, classic Ipv4 is assumed. 
%% The EngineId value is only used if Inform-Requests are sent to this
%% target.  If Informs are not sent, this value is ignored, and can be
%% e.g. an empty string.  However, if Informs are sent, it is essential
%% that the value of EngineId matches the value of the target's
%% actual snmpEngineID.
%% For example
%% {"1.2.3.4 v1", [1,2,3,4], 162, 
%%  1500, 3, "std_inform", "otp_v2", "",
%%  [127,0,0,0],  2048}.
